Raven, raven by the pond<br>
Come to sit where I belong<br>
Call me princess, guard your queen<br>
Visit me by the window seem<br><br>
            
Tell me tales of other ravens<br>
And how you've seen and roamed the heavens<br>
Tell me I could climb a tree<br>
Fairytales that tell of me<br><br>
            
Lead me to a closed off garden<br>
Hide me in your feathered garments<br>
Let me tell you of a time<br>
When my red hair wasn't mine!<br><br>
            
Raven raven i can't see you<br>
Im a mute swan you're an eagle<br>
Like to hunt for my own fish<br>
But you may dream my secret wish<br>
