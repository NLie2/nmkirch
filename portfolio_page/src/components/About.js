      <h1> About </h1> 
      <p> I am a Master student in Artificial Intelligence with a background in cognitive psychology and philosophy. My Masters thesis deals with ethical benchmarking and scalable oversight of large language based systems.
        Next to my studies, I completed a full-stack software engineering bootcamp and worked at a R&D department at a tech- startup. I also co-founded an AI safety student association.
        I am incredibly passionate about learning and am proud to call myself a generalist, which reflects in my diverse background. 
        In the future, I would love to keep working on projects on the intersection of AI and software development, in an effort to positively shape the future of humanity with Artificial Inelligence.
