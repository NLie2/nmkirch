Raven, raven by the pond
Come to sit where I belong
Call me princess, guard your queen
Visit me by the window seem
            
Tell me tales of other ravens
And how you've seen and roamed the heavens
Tell me I could climb a tree
Fairytales that tell of me
            
Lead me to a closed off garden
Hide me in your feathered garments
Let me tell you of a time
When my red hair wasn't mine!
            
Raven raven i can't see you
Im a mute swan you're an eagle
Like to hunt for my own fish
But you may dream my secret wish
