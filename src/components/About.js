      <h1> Hi, I'm Nathalie Maria </h1>

      <p> I hold an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from Utrecht University and will soon begin my PhD in Computer Science at King's College London. Currently, I am an ERA research fellow, focusing on a project in mechanistic interpretability of Large Language Models (LLMs) under the supervision of Stephen Casper (MIT). My broader research interests include mechanistic interpretability, machine ethics, and adversarial robustness. <br/><br/>  Please have a low bar for reaching out if you are interested in collaborating or discussing research ideas. :)
